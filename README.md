# Online-Code-Compiler
This project is an online compiler for C code. It allows users to write, compile, and run C programs directly in the browser. Users can also provide input to their programs, which is passed through the standard input (scanf) function. The project uses Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and CodeMirror for the backend, and Bootstrap for the frontend.
